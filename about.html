            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 Pandemic completely flipped our world upside down. All classes were moved online.
                Teachers and students frantically tried to adjust. Prom was cancelled. Graduation: recorded
                in advance.
                <br><br>
                But that hasn't stopped us at all from staying postive! Even though we are all quarantined
                in our little homes, we still find ways to stay connected and united. You all created
                online events in order to go through desparate times <b>together</b> as a school. From hosting
                online Mini-Desk Concerts to having Talk Circles Around Race, we have only proven that although
                we're going through some tough times right now, we are resilient and adapting.
                <br><br>
                So in the spirit of adapting, the Senior Caucus has thought of ways for all of us to get
                together and contribute to create something for all of us to look back at. This website was
                created to compile all that was made so you don't have to dig through tons of emails or Facebook
                posts to find again. It's all right here. Plus, this website won't ever disappear because it'll
                always be on github pages, so you can even view this website many years from now.
                <br><br>
                On the tabs above, you can see some of the memories we made during quarantine. There's a college
                map of where (nearly) everybody is going to college, serviced through Google MyMaps. There's also
                a banner and inspired by Yale's class of 2024 banner. Finally, there's a collage with the
                Quarantine selfies we all took in the beginning of March. Background image in title page is credited

                <br>
                <p id="final">And on a final note, GO CLASS OF 2020! Achieve big and leave a <b>lasting legacy!</b><p>
